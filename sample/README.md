# Directory Overview

This directory contains some sample files that were used for testing purposes in the creation of the parser. There is:

- a sample financial disclosure report PDF
- two files containing the text extracted from each page of the report using `pypdf`

The assumption is that the structure of this text will be consistent across reports, so this is just present for the viewer to understand what the parser was built from.
