- bad news. the table header for this is different from the previous ones we've seen. instead of "ID Owner Asset Transaction Type Date Notification Date Amount Cap. Gains > $200?", it's "Asset Owner Date Tx. Type Amount Cap. Gains > $200?". so no ID column, asset and owner are flipped, there's no notification date, the transaction type column is renamed
- on page 13, a transaction is split across page boundaries. it throws off the order of the way in which a transaction is parsed, as the first page contains part of the asset's name, part of the transaction type, the date, and the amount, while the second page contains the remainder of the name and the remainder of the transaction type. such a transaction might have to be discarded. i don't know that my parser can be made sufficiently robust for it
- the table footer is also different. there's a sentence in between the star and the rest of the words i match against. there's also two. one at the end of the first schedule, and one at the end of the schedule in which the transactions are present. my current parser deletes everything after the first match. that might need to change. it's not guaranteed that the end of the transaction schedule is the last occurence of this though...
